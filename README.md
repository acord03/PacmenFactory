# PacmenFactory
A interactive exercise we did when learning to make buttons change the page

In order to spawn a new PacMan image, you press the "Add PacMan" button
In order to start/quicken the movement of the images you press the "Start Game" button

In the future, I plan to add a button that changes the color of the background to a random color of the rainbow.
